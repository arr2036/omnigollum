# omnigollum - omniauth meets gollum

## Installation

### Manual

Clone into your ruby library path.

    git clone git://github.com/arr2036/omnigollum.git

## Configuration

Omnigollum executes an OmniAuth::Builder proc/block to figure out which providers you've configured,
then passes it on to omniauth to create the actual omniauth configuration.

To configure both omniauth and omnigollum you should add the following to your config.ru file.

### Load omnigollum library
```ruby
require 'omnigollum'
```

### Load individual provider libraries
```ruby
require 'omniauth/strategies/twitter'
require 'omniauth/strategies/open_id'
```

### Set configuration
```ruby
options = {
  # OmniAuth::Builder block is passed as a proc
  :providers => Proc.new do
    provider :twitter, 'CONSUMER_KEY', 'CONSUMER_SECRET'
    provider :open_id, OpenID::Store::Filesystem.new('/tmp')
  end,
  :dummy_auth => false
}

# :omnigollum options *must* be set before the Omnigollum extension is registered
Precious::App.set(:omnigollum, options)
```

### Access control

By default, any authenticated user will be able to access the protected routes. Restrict this by setting the `authorized_users` option.

`authorized_users` accepts an array of emails. Users must authenticate with one of these authorized emails in order to be allowed access.

```ruby
options[:authorized_users] = ["john@fourthcoffee.com", "susan@fourthcoffee.com", "james@fourthcoffee.com"]
```

Instead of setting these directly, you can use an [env var](http://www.12factor.net/config), maybe like this:

```ruby
# in .env, or other
# OMNIGOLLUM_AUTHORIZED_USERS=john@fourthcoffee.com,susan@fourthcoffee.com,james@fourthcoffee.com

options[:authorized_users] = ENV["OMNIGOLLUM_AUTHORIZED_USERS"].split(",")
```

### Register omnigollum extension with sinatra
```ruby
Precious::App.register Omnigollum::Sinatra
```

## Required patches

### mustache

https://github.com/defunkt/mustache

Must be at v0.99.5 (currently unreleased), replace the gem version with 6c4e12d58844d99909df or
the current HEAD.

Feel free to complain loudly that the maintainer should roll a new gem.

### Gollum
You can also (optionally) apply the patches here, to get a neat little auth
status widget in the top right corner of the page https://github.com/arr2036/gollum/commit/32de2cad920ccc6e955b8e19f6e23c2b3b4c8964
